# Paper Replications Based on AI/ML Papers through Literature

Completed:
- DCGAN with application cat faces (64x64)

Next:
- Pix2Pix

TODO:
- Pix2Pix model creation is mostly done, I think the shapes are right but it keeps slowing my computer
- I think the best course of action is to use AWS to build and train the model then find a way to save it to my machine/upload it here
